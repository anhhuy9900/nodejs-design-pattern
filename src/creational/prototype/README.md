The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used to create new objects by copying an existing object,
known as the prototype.
This pattern is particularly useful when the creation of an object is expensive (in terms of time or resources)
or when creating new instances by cloning or copying is more efficient than constructing from scratch.
